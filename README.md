# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, developed in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). Players can compete against the computer in this timeless hand game, with each match's outcome (win, lose, or draw) determined by a set of predefined rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xotlr/cs-rps.git


## Getting Started
- Upon launching the game, you will be greeted with a simple GUI presenting three buttons: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Select your choice to play against the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated.
- The result of each round is displayed immediately, updating the scores and providing a message about the outcome.
- The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores, which are displayed at the top of the window.
